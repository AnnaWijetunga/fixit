    // i.e. Static methods are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance. 
    // Used to create utility functions for an application - don't need to be made into instances
    // Because static methods are called directly on the classes themselves, static methods have no access to data stored in specific objects.

        // 2) set the headers, for sending/receiving in json
        // 3) set a body that contains JSON content. Since JSON content is required, call JSON.stringify when you set the body

        // configurationObject has 3 core components:
        // 1) HTTP Verb - default is GET, so we need to state method: POST
        // 2) Headers - metadata about the actual data we want to send; headers are sent just ahead of the actual data payload of our POST request. They contain information about the data being sent.
        // "Content-Type" is used to indicate what format the data being sent is in.
        // Just like "Content-Type" tells the destination server what type of data we're sending, it is also good practice to tell the server what data format we accept in return.
        // To do this, we add a second header, "Accept", and assign it to "application/json"
        // 3) Last, add the data. Data being sent in fetch() must be stored in the body of the configurationObject.
        // Note: when data is exchanged between a client (your browser, for instance), and a server, the data is sent as TEXT. Whatever data we're assigning to the body of our request needs to be a STRING.

            // Element.innerHTML returns HTML, as its name indicates. Sometimes people use innerHTML to retrieve or write text inside an element, but textContent has better performance because its value is not parsed as HTML.

// HOISTING
// An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not
// You first need to declare your class and then access it
// Same goes for class expressions

// “hoisting” deals with how function and variable declarations get raised to the top of the current scope.
// The term for this process is /hoisting/ because it feels a bit like your declarations are being hoisted, or raised, to the top of the current scope. 
// Your declarations *are* being evaluated before the rest of your code gets run.
// Declare your functions at the very top of your code to avoid this.

// Important to know:

// The get keyword is used in classes for methods which serve the specific purpose of retrieving data from an instance.
// The get keyword turns a method into a 'pseudo-property', that is - it allows us to write a method that interacts like a property.
// Using get, an expensive process can be delayed - only run when we need it, distributing the workload more evenly.

// To change data, we have set.
// The set keyword allows us to write a method that interacts like a property being assigned a value. 
// By adding it in conjunction with a get, we can create a 'reassignable' pseudo-property.

// private properties
// this._firstName (syntax)

// sanitize (example)
// class Student {
//   constructor(firstName, lastName) {
//     this._firstName = this.sanitize(firstName);
//     this._lastName = this.sanitize(lastName);
//   }
// We are tasked with making sure names do not have any non-alphanumeric characters except for those that appear in names. 
// This is sometimes referred to as sanitizing text.

// removes any non alpha-numeric characters except dash and single quotes (apostrophes)
// sanitize(string) 
//     return string.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9-']+/g, '');
//   }
// }
